**** Codes for "Parental mixed-gender preferences revealed by IVF twin births"

* The program is divided into six parts:
*
* Part 1: Compilation of raw data (in STATA).
* Part 2: Estimation of the proportion of delivering mothers who adopt IVF in the mother group indexed by age (a) and family wealth-rank (w) in period (t) using Nonlinear Least Squares (NLS) regression (in STATA).
* Part 3: Estimation of the gender preference parameters of first-birth mothers who adopt IVFs (using Maximum Likelihood Estimation, MLE, in R).
* Part 4: Calculation of the MLE standard errors of parameters and the values used in Figures 3 and 4 based on the estimates obtained in Part 3 (in STATA).
* Part 5: To examine an alternative classification scheme, where wealth and age are divided into seven and five groups, respectively.
* Part 6: To employ a logit regression to examine the effects of the IVF percentage, wealth, and the IVF success rate on multiple birth outcomes and the one-boy-one-girl twin rate.
